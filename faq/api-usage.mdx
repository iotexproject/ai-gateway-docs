  <Accordion title="How do I get an API key?">
    Visit [gateway.iotex.ai/console/token](https://gateway.iotex.ai/console/token) to obtain your API key. Each key is unique to your account, ensuring usage security and accurate statistics.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Do API keys have an expiration date?">
    API keys are valid long-term by default, but we recommend regular rotation for security reasons. You can manage and rotate your keys in the [Gateway Console](https://gateway.iotex.ai/console/token).
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I use multiple API keys simultaneously?">
    Yes, you can create different API keys for different projects or environments (development, staging, production), making usage tracking and management easier.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Is the API compatible with the OpenAI SDK?">
    Yes. IoTeX AI Gateway is fully compatible with the OpenAI API format. You can use the official OpenAI SDK in Python, JavaScript, or any other language — just change the `base_url` and `api_key`.
